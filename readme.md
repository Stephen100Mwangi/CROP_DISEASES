# Quick Start

`Crop Health` is a web application that uses AI to help farmers quickly identify crop diseases through image recognition and provides tailored recommendations for treatment. The project aims to empower farmers with early disease detection to reduce crop losses and improve agricultural yield.

2. Typescript
3. Node.js
4. Python

### Databases

1. PostgreSQL
2. PrismaORM

## Key Features

This application will seek to address several key concerns focusing on a wide range of m=notable features from security and role based access control to machine learning, file upload and communication via [Websockets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-web-socket-and-how-it-is-different-from-the-http/)

## Key Notes on Development Decisions

### Frontend Decisions

1. Font
For a crop diseases detection application, the design should reflect a sense of **trust, clarity, and nature**. The color palette and fonts should help convey a connection to agriculture while ensuring readability and accessibility.
**Roboto**: A modern sans-serif font that is highly readable and well-suited for UI/UX design.
**Montserrat**: A clean and professional sans-serif font that works well for headings and body text.
**Open Sans**: A versatile and easy-to-read sans-serif font, suitable for both headings and regular text.
**Poppins**: A stylish sans-serif font with geometric shapes, great for headings and emphasizing key information.
**Lato**: A humanist sans-serif font that adds a friendly and warm touch, suitable for subheadings and captions.

2. Color Palette

**Primary Colors**:

**Green** (representing healthy crops and nature): `#4CAF50` (a fresh and vibrant green)
**Brown** (for soil and earth tones): `#8D6E63` (a warm, earthy brown)
**Yellow** (for warnings or alerts about disease): `#FFEB3B` (a bright and attention-grabbing yellow)

**Dark Green**: `#2E7D32` (for headings or emphasis)
**Muted Beige**: `#D7CCC8` (as a soft, neutral background color)
**Red** (to indicate disease or problems): `#F44336` (a bold red for critical alerts)

**Light Blue**: `#81D4FA` (for highlighting actionable items or information)
**Soft Gray**: `#E0E0E0` (for borders, dividers, and less important text)

This combination of colors and fonts creates a professional, approachable, and nature-inspired interface for your application.
